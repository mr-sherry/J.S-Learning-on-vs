// Sure! Here's a question for you to solve using the topics you mentioned:

// **Question:**  
// Write a JavaScript program that takes a student's name, their marks in 5 subjects (stored in an array), and calculates the total and average marks. Then, use an `if-else` statement to determine the grade based on the following criteria:  

// - **90 and above:** Grade A  
// - **80 - 89:** Grade B  
// - **70 - 79:** Grade C  
// - **60 - 69:** Grade D  
// - **Below 60:** Grade F  

// Use a function to perform the calculations, and store the student's details in an object. Also, use a `switch` statement to print a remark based on the grade.  

// Give it a try! Let me know if you need any hints. ðŸ˜Š
